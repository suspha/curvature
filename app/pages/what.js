        <h1>What is Earth Curvature?</h1>
        <div>
          The Earth is not a perfect sphere but rather an oblate spheroid,
          meaning it is slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the
          equator. Despite this, for most practical purposes, the Earth's
          curvature can be approximated using simple spherical geometry. Over
          large distances, this curvature becomes noticeable and can affect
          line-of-sight observations, long-distance measurements, and even
          architectural and engineering projects.
